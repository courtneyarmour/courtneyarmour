Vertebrates are chronically exposed to environmental chemicals through multiple routes including inhalation, ingestion, and absorption through the skin. Acute exposure to many environmental chemicals has been associated with negative health effects including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and reproductive defects. Several environmental chemical exposures are known to disrupt the microbiome. For example, my work has demonstrated that the antimicrobial triclosan disrupts the taxonomic structure and ecological interactions of the gut microbiome. However, when compared to the volume and diversity of exposures that humans experience daily, we still know very about little about the impact of these chemicals on the physiology and function of the gut microbiome. A primary focus of my work has been to quantify how environmental exposures affect host-microbiome interactions.

Micronutrient deficiency is one of the most pervasive public health conditions, affecting more than two billion people worldwide. Micronutrient deficiencies associate with increased susceptibility to disease and heightened toxicity of environmental chemicals including arsenic. These chemicals can be extensively modified through interactions with the gut microbiome, thus micronutrient deficiency induced disruption of microbiome operation may alter these modifications. As a postdoc, I have characterized how alterations in host gene expression associate with operational and taxonomic changes of the microbiome during zinc deficiency.  My research has also demonstrated that zinc deficiency sensitizes the microbiome to perturbation with arsenic exposure and is associated with increased inflammation and cellular DNA damage. My continuing research seeks to determine how dietary variation driven changes in microbiome operation associates with physiological changes in the host.
